This repository contains 

Matlab Algorithm - The algorithm developed for the barrel distoriton correction in the matlab. The matlab algorithm folder contais the software correction algorithm that was developed.

The RTL design for the micro Architecture- The RTL design can be found in the folder barrel_distortion_correction and line_buffer_for_bcd. 

Presentation for the Mesters Thesis. 

barrel_distortion_correction: This folder contails the RTL design for the Correction module which includes the barrel distortion coordinate correction module and the back mapping module design source and simulation files. additional files can be found in following gogle drive for barrel distortion coordinate correction module which whcih culd not be pushed due to ssues in size whie - [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1QJjeHncnTOHg1SA4_6KgEjnpPDGjnQOh](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QJjeHncnTOHg1SA4_6KgEjnpPDGjnQOh?usp=drive_link).

line_buffer_for_bcd: This folder contails the RTL design for the line buffer memory with read and wtrite control.
